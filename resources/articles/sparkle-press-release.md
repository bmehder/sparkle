# 🟣 SparkleWorks Press Release  
## For Immediate and Possibly Inevitable Distribution

**April 2025 — Somewhere near a blinking cursor**

## ✨ Announcing Sparkle 1.0:  
### A Microframework for People Who Think Frameworks Are Suspicious

Sparkle is here. It's small. It composes. It doesn't need a build tool. It might be the first UI framework that actively encourages you to read your own code.

### What is Sparkle?

- A tiny, immutable state engine powered by pure functions  
- A bead-based architecture for composing UI behavior  
- A reactive core powered by **Blink** — a dead-simple signal system  
- A toolkit with a name that is more cheerful than its existential implications

Sparkle doesn’t care how you organize your files. It doesn’t have a CLI. It will not "infer" anything about your intentions. You wire up the DOM yourself. Like an adult.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Beads, not components** — Composable units of behavior, not code tombs  
- **Explicit render functions** — You write them. You control them. You suffer or thrive accordingly  
- **update() that updates** — No proxies. No hooks. Just a function  
- **Reactive rendering via Blink** — No VDOM, just signals and effects  
- **No build step** — Because we have nothing to prove  
- **100% JavaScript** — The good kind. The kind you can actually open and read

## 🎁 Included in Sparkle 1.0

- Toggle app — because nothing screams UI like Boolean state  
- Timer app — for counting the seconds until you switch back to React  
- Counter app — bold, innovative, increments things  
- Carousel widget — embeddable, scrollable, emotionally neutral  

All apps come in `apps/` so you can spend your weekend deleting them and writing your own.

---

## 🧠 Who Is This For?

Sparkle is for developers who:

- Know what a function is  
- Know what a function does  
- Think “minimal” means fewer than 3 layers of indirection  
- Would rather understand the code than vibe with the framework

If you’re allergic to magic but still want your UI to sparkle (in a completely deterministic way), this is for you.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmehder/sparkle.git
```

## 🕳 Where This Is Going

We don’t know. It could stay tiny. It could get reactive (and now it has). We might write 8 more widgets or rename `withCountToggles`. But for now, it works. And that’s enough sparkle for today.
