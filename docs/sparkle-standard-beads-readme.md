# ðŸŒŸ Sparkle Standard Beads

The `sparkle-standard-beads` collection provides a curated set of generic, reusable, pure-function beads to enhance your Sparkle apps with common UI behaviors.

Each bead follows these principles:

- âœ… Pure function signature
- âœ… Uses `createBead()` for clarity and conflict detection
- âœ… Namespaced or convention-safe method names
- âœ… Works seamlessly with `bedazzle()` and `createApp()`
